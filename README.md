# Cloud Based IoT Energy Management System
An Energy Management System built for the purpose of improving Home Enegery Usage Efficiency.
LIVE DEMO : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67l0wjL0xx0&t=7s

This system was built, CLoud Technologies and systems to enable consistent, location-independent access to energy information.


![Flowchart](https://github.com/wintercameearly/undergrad_proj/blob/master/cronos.jpeg)
mqtttest.py is the mqtt client for sending data to adafruit.io and controlling the devices connected to it 

EnergyDisaggregation.py is responsible for visualizing disaggregated energy from whole home loads 
LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network implemented using tensorflow

Built using GCP services (BigQuery,ML Engine, IoT Core, PubSub, e.t.c)

Deployment instructions can be found here : https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services/tree/master/examples/e2e-home-appliance-status-monitoring

Still very much a work in progress

This work is possible very much due to the examples provided by Google , Very Grateful to them !
