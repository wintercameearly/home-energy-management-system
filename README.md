# undergrad_proj
A repository of codes used for my undergrad project, a home energy management system 

IoT driven ENERGY MANAGEMENT built on CLOUD technologies

![Flowchart](https://github.com/wintercameearly/undergrad_proj/blob/master/drawio.jpg)
mqtttest.py is the mqtt client for sending data to adafruit.io and controlling the devices connected to it 

EnergyDisaggregation.py is responsible for visualizing disaggregated energy from whole home loads 

Built using GCP services (BigQuery,ML Engine, IoT Core, PubSub, e.t.c)

Deployment instructions can be found here : https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services/tree/master/examples/e2e-home-appliance-status-monitoring

Still very much a work in progress

This work is possible very much due to the examples provided by Google , Very Grateful to them !
